# Experimental Goals Framework

The Experimental Goals Framework provides a structured approach to research and validate key hypotheses about Spec-Driven Development and modern software engineering practices.

## Overview

Our research and experimentation focus on four core experimental goals:

1. **🔧 Technology Independence**: Validate that Spec-Driven Development is technology-agnostic
