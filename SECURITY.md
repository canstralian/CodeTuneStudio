## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Private Security Advisory** (Preferred)
   - Go to the repository's Security tab
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the advisory form

2. **Email**
   - Send details to the maintainers (check SECURITY.md in the repository for current contact)
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
   - Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

### What to Include in Your Report

Please include as much information as possible:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, RCE)
- Full paths of affected source files
- Location of the affected code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if available)
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

## Security Update Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and determine its severity
3. **Fix Development**: We will develop and test a fix
4. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate disclosure timing with you
5. **Release**: We will release a security update and advisory

## Security Best Practices

When contributing to this project:

1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables for all credentials
2. **Validate all inputs**: Use the security utilities in `utils/security.py`
3. **Use parameterized queries**: Never concatenate SQL queries
4. **Sanitize outputs**: Escape all user-provided content
5. **Review the security documentation**: See `docs/SECURITY_BEST_PRACTICES.md`

## Automated Security Scanning

This repository uses:

- **Bandit**: Python code security scanner
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanner
- **CodeQL**: Advanced semantic code analysis
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

Security scans run:
- On every push to main/develop branches
- On every pull request
- Daily at 2 AM UTC (scheduled)

## Security Features

This project implements:

- Input validation and sanitization utilities
- Secure code execution patterns (sandboxing)
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Secure session management
- Security headers for web responses
- Parameterized database queries
- Error message sanitization
- Timeout enforcement for long-running operations

## Known Security Considerations

### Code Execution
This project may execute user-provided code in certain features. We implement:
- Code validation before execution
- Sandboxed execution environments
- Timeout enforcement
- Resource limitations

### API Security
API endpoints implement:
- Authentication via API keys
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- CSRF protection

### Database Security
Database operations use:
- SQLAlchemy ORM (parameterized queries)
- Connection pooling with secure defaults
- Automatic connection health checks

## Third-Party Dependencies

We regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities:

- Automated updates via Dependabot
- Security scanning with Safety
- Manual review of critical dependencies

## Compliance

This project follows:

- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- [CWE Top 25](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/)
- Python security best practices

## Questions?

For questions about security, please:
1. Review the security documentation in `docs/SECURITY_BEST_PRACTICES.md`
2. Check existing security advisories
3. Contact the maintainers (for sensitive questions)
