# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The following versions of CodeTuneStudio are currently supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

**Note:** CodeTuneStudio is currently in early development (version 0.1.0). As the project matures, we will expand our version support policy.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your help in responsibly disclosing any issues you find.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:

**📧 distortedprojection@gmail.com**

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the vulnerability
- **Location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the vulnerability** and potential attack scenarios
- **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

### What to Expect

- **Initial Response:** You will receive an acknowledgment of your report within **48 hours**.
- **Status Updates:** We will keep you informed about the progress of addressing the vulnerability at least once every **7 days**.
- **Timeline:** We aim to provide a fix or mitigation within **30 days** for critical vulnerabilities, and **90 days** for lower severity issues.
- **Credit:** With your permission, we will credit you in our security advisories and release notes.

### Our Commitment

If your vulnerability report is accepted:

- ✅ We will work with you to understand and validate the issue
- ✅ We will develop and test a fix as quickly as possible
- ✅ We will coordinate the disclosure timeline with you
- ✅ We will credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- ✅ We will publish a security advisory once the fix is released

If your vulnerability report is declined:

- ℹ️ We will provide a clear explanation of why we do not consider it a security issue
- ℹ️ You may appeal the decision by providing additional context or evidence
- ℹ️ We will update you on any changes to our assessment

## Security Best Practices

When using CodeTuneStudio, please follow these security best practices:

### For Users

1. **Environment Variables:** Never commit `.env` files or hardcode sensitive credentials
2. **API Keys:** Store all API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace) in environment variables
3. **Database Security:** Use strong passwords and secure connection strings
4. **Access Control:** Restrict access to your CodeTuneStudio instance to trusted networks
5. **Updates:** Keep CodeTuneStudio and its dependencies up to date
6. **Dependencies:** Regularly run `safety check` to scan for vulnerable dependencies

### For Contributors

1. **Code Review:** All code changes must go through security review
2. **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize user inputs
3. **Parameterized Queries:** Use SQLAlchemy ORM or parameterized queries for database operations
4. **Output Encoding:** Properly escape outputs to prevent XSS
5. **Authentication:** Implement proper authentication and authorization for API endpoints
6. **Logging:** Log security events without exposing sensitive information

See our [Copilot Instructions](.github/copilot-instructions.md) for detailed security guidelines.

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Security Features

- ✅ Environment-based secrets management
- ✅ SQLAlchemy ORM for SQL injection prevention
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization utilities
- ✅ Secure logging without credential exposure
- ✅ HTTPS support for production deployments

### Areas Under Active Development

- 🔄 Rate limiting for API endpoints
- 🔄 Enhanced authentication mechanisms
- 🔄 CSRF protection for web interface
- 🔄 Security headers configuration
- 🔄 Audit logging for sensitive operations

## Security Tools

We recommend using the following tools to identify potential security issues:

```bash
# Scan Python dependencies for known vulnerabilities
pip install safety
safety check

# Static security analysis for Python code
pip install bandit
bandit -r . -f json -o bandit-report.json

# Code quality and style checks
flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
```

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Disclosure:** Security issues should be reported privately
2. **Coordinated Release:** We will coordinate public disclosure with the reporter
3. **Grace Period:** We request a 90-day grace period before public disclosure
4. **Security Advisories:** We will publish security advisories on GitHub

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:

- Published in GitHub Security Advisories
- Announced in release notes
- Tagged with `[SECURITY]` in commit messages
- Documented in this SECURITY.md file
