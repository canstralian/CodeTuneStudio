**Release Date**: October 5, 2025
**Release Type**: Patch (Security & Bug Fixes)
**Priority**: 🚨 **CRITICAL** - Immediate upgrade recommended

---

## 🔐 Security Advisories

### **CRITICAL**: Streamlit File Upload Vulnerability

**CVE**: Not assigned
**Severity**: HIGH
**CVSS**: Not scored
**Affected Versions**: CodeTuneStudio ≤0.1.0 (using Streamlit ≤1.42.0)

#### Vulnerability Details

A security vulnerability was discovered in Streamlit's `st.file_uploader` widget that enables attackers to upload malicious files to cloud instances running Streamlit applications. This vulnerability was disclosed by Cato Networks in February 2025.

**Attack Vector**: Remote
**Impact**:
- Unauthorized file upload
- Potential cloud account takeover
- Malicious code execution
- Data exfiltration

**Patch**: Streamlit 1.43.2 (released March 11, 2025) introduces backend validation to enforce file-type restrictions.

#### Mitigation

**Action Required**: Upgrade immediately to CodeTuneStudio v0.1.1

```bash
# Option 1: Upgrade via uv (recommended)
uv pip install --upgrade streamlit>=1.43.2

# Option 2: Upgrade via pip
pip install --upgrade streamlit>=1.43.2

# Option 3: Reinstall CodeTuneStudio v0.1.1
uv pip install -e ".[dev]" --upgrade
```

**Verification**:
```bash
python -c "import streamlit; print(streamlit.__version__)"
# Expected output: 1.43.2 or higher
```

### **HIGH**: Transformers ReDoS Vulnerability (CVE-2025-2099)

**Severity**: HIGH
**CVSS**: 7.5
**Status**: ⚠️ Monitoring for patch

CodeTuneStudio v0.1.1 uses Transformers 4.48.2, which may be vulnerable to CVE-2025-2099 (confirmed in v4.48.3). This is a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the `preprocess_string()` function.

**Impact**: High CPU usage, potential DoS
**Temporary Mitigation**: None required - vulnerability primarily affects testing utilities
**Planned Fix**: Upgrade to Transformers ≥4.48.4 in v0.1.2 when released

### ✅ PyTorch CVE-2025-32434 - Already Mitigated

**CVE**: CVE-2025-32434
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**CVSS**: 9.3
**Status**: ✅ PATCHED

CodeTuneStudio v0.1.0+ already uses PyTorch 2.6.0, which patches the critical remote code execution vulnerability in `torch.load()` with `weights_only=True`.

**No action required** - you're already protected.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Code Quality & Stability

1. **Fixed duplicate function definition** (components/dataset_selector.py:43-44)
   - **Issue**: `get_argilla_dataset_manager()` was defined twice
   - **Impact**: Undefined behavior from function shadowing
   - **Fix**: Consolidated into single implementation with enhanced error handling

2. **Fixed duplicate docstring** (components/tokenizer_builder.py)
   - **Issue**: Function had two docstrings (one truncated)
   - **Impact**: Documentation inconsistency
   - **Fix**: Removed duplicate, kept comprehensive version

3. **Fixed misplaced docstring** (utils/argilla_dataset.py)
   - **Issue**: Docstring appeared before function signature
   - **Impact**: IDE/tooling couldn't parse documentation
   - **Fix**: Moved docstring to correct position

### Performance Improvements

4. **Restored LRU caching on `validate_dataset_name()`**
   - **Issue**: Cache decorator was removed in previous refactoring
   - **Impact**: Reduced performance for repeated validations
   - **Fix**: Restored `@lru_cache(maxsize=128)` (increased from 32)

### Functional Enhancements

5. **Enhanced dataset name validation**
   - **Added**: Support for `/` character in regex pattern
   - **Pattern**: `r"^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-/]+$"`
   - **Benefit**: Properly validates HuggingFace namespaced datasets (e.g., `google/code_x_glue`)

6. **Improved Argilla error handling**
   - **Added**: Try/except for ArgillaDatasetManager import
   - **Benefit**: Graceful degradation when Argilla unavailable
   - **Logging**: Better error messages for debugging
