# Dependency Resolution and Python Version Standardization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to resolve dependency conflicts and standardize Python version requirements across the CodeTuneStudio repository.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Dependency Conflicts
- **evaluate package**: Already resolved to `evaluate==0.4.6` (was previously referencing unavailable `evaluate==0.5.1`)
- **numpy package**: Already resolved to `numpy>=1.19.3,<2` (removes conflict with `numpy==2.3.3`)

### 2. Python Version Inconsistencies
Standardized Python version to **3.10** across all configuration files to match the CI/CD infrastructure.

## Files Modified

### Configuration Files
1. **pyproject.toml**
   - Changed `requires-python = ">=3.11"` to `requires-python = ">=3.10"`
   - Changed `target-version = "py311"` to `target-version = "py310"`

2. **setup.cfg**
   - Changed `python_version = 3.8` to `python_version = 3.10`

3. **README.md**
   - Updated badge from `Python 3.9+` to `Python 3.10+`
   - Updated prerequisites from "Python 3.8 or higher" to "Python 3.10 or higher"

4. **.github/workflows/ci.yml**
   - Changed matrix from `[3.9, 3.10, 3.11]` to `["3.10"]` for consistency

## Verification

### Requirements.txt Status
```plaintext
✅ evaluate==0.4.6 (compatible with PyPI)
✅ numpy>=1.19.3,<2 (no version conflicts)
```

### Python Version Consistency
All files now reference Python 3.10:
- ✅ pyproject.toml: `>=3.10`
- ✅ setup.cfg: `3.10`
- ✅ README.md: `3.10+`
- ✅ CI workflow: `["3.10"]`
- ✅ Dockerfile: `3.10` (already correct)
- ✅ All other GitHub Actions workflows: `3.10` (already correct)

## Testing
The changes have been validated:
1. Configuration files parse correctly (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg)
2. Dependency dry-run installation completes without conflicts
3. All workflow files use consistent Python version

## Impact
- **CI/CD**: Workflows now test against a single, consistent Python version (3.10)
- **Development**: Developers must use Python 3.10 or higher
- **Dependencies**: All package versions are compatible and available on PyPI
- **Documentation**: README accurately reflects required Python version

## Recommendations
1. Update local development environments to Python 3.10
2. Ensure virtual environments are recreated with Python 3.10
3. Test application functionality with Python 3.10 before deploying
